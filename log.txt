| * [1;34m56de687[m - [1;32m(6 days ago)[m [30madded note that what is missing from this proposal is an intigration of the theory from the class. ie Andy Lavender- performance in the twenty-first century see perhaps blurring between performer and spectator and awareness of being both. archive and the repertoire and GITHUB? possible thinking through post-postmodernism as a 'return to praxis, materiality, getting things done' (someone in class...) but also copresence see:colocation. what is mackenzie's formulation of technical performance? engagement isn't just about affect, its about temporality, the nowness of being connected. ALSO Bay-Cheng article how the traces are different fromt the original. as lavender also writes about the diff between gen x and y that y knows they're being watched, this also feeds into github being a social network with profiles. I get satisfaction from seeing my commit frequency displayed on my front page. see also EJ Westlake. possible harvie, see page 26 and 30, then page 109 on craftmanship driven by quality of work[m [2;30m- michaelpalumbo[m[m
