        This paper presents a vision towards the use of version control systems and repository mining in the contexts of performance studies and creativity research, and will leverage git as a research-creation tool in presenting a detailed account of this paper’s own ontogenesis, such as: excerpts from the author’s commit comments; visualizations of the comparison of changes; and trends in the author’s process, including attentional detail and affect.

        The finished version of this papge will be the paper, including hypertext, tables, and embedded video of vizualizations.

        When working on a project, the ability to keep track of changes made by a creator over time, is essential to many facets of production, including revision, editing, moving between drafts, collecting and implementing feedback. Collaboration demands further scaffolding of communication and distributed activity, such as facilitating concurrent access to the developing corpus of work, effectively managing how work and knowledge about the work-in-progress are shared, and to be able to move efficiently between drafts and revisions. In the field of software engineering, version control systems (VCS) are employed by developers to mitigate these issues by storing code in digital archives — referred to as repositories — which contain details about the history of the project, contributions, and other useful metrics. (Bird et al. 2009) (Carlsson 2013) Drawing on literature from [[the Performance and Culture course including Lavender, Bay-Cheng, Harvie, and Taylor; distributed creativity, and mining software repositories (MSR)]] this paper presents a vision towards the use of version control systems and repository mining in the contexts of performance studies and distributed creativity research, and will leverage git as a research-creation tool in presenting a detailed account of this paper’s own ontogenesis, such as: excerpts from the author’s commit comments; visualizations of the comparison of changes; and trends in the author’s process, including attentional detail and affect.

      \emph{Centralized version control} systems, such as Subversion and Concurrent Versioning System [cite] host the code at a single remote location, permitting developers temporary access to a portion of the codebase for modification. [cite]

      A more recent VCS model is that of \emph{decentralized version control} (DVC), such as git, which operates on a peer-to-peer model, enabling the entire repository to be stored locally on all machines affiliated with the project, (O’Sullivan 2009) thereby facilitating temporally and geographically displaced contributions, offline work, and simultaneous document editing. (Kalliamvakou et al 2014) The DVC workflow in git comprises three primary actions: the retrieval of up-to-date code from the remote repository to a local repository on the developer’s machine, called a 'pull'

      the logging of the modification of work in the local repository, called a \emph{commit}, which contains a description of the change and reason(s) for its occurrence, written by the person responsible for said change; and the uploading of files staged in commits, called a \emph{push}.

      Built on top of git is Github.com, the most prominent service offering a DVC platform. As of late 2016, Github.com is host to over 21 million publicly available repositories in the cloud. Such access to open data facilitates unprecedented knowledge sharing and mass collaboration, and affords researchers access to rich datasets, about which insights can be gained over the interdependence of creators and artefacts, how these entities interact over the lifecycle of a project, and the propagation of ideas.

      Of particular interest to performance studies scholarship is the curious fact that such systems are not limited solely to the indexing of code. Rather, most file extensions may be archived and tracked, including those used often in writing and research, such as .docx, .xls, and .txt. At this outset, the author hypothesizes that the ability to freely distribute an artwork-in-process and concurrently analyze its content and social [connectivity? network?] both quantitatively -- i.e. usage metrics, pattern recognition on the contents of the docs, etc -- and qualitatively -- i.e. ethnographic study of the commit messages, grounded theory analysis of issue or bug messages, etc -- is of fascinating consequence. [[weave in arguments from bay-cheng, lavender?]]
      </p>

      <p>
      As a corollary to this assertion of using git as both an archival and revision tool in non-software development practices, this paper as a work-in-progress is currently hosted at https://michaelpalumbo.github.io/paper/ , and is being composed along a rule that deems changes be committed frequently. As an example of two commits pertaining to the development of this very sentence, see <a href="https://github.com/michaelpalumbo/self-referent/commit/ed35d4f5016282efbc67a8cd7b6d81a0048a9217">this commit</a>, and then compare with <a href="https://github.com/michaelpalumbo/self-referent/commit/41cdeac813edd0403299e30d0ac16207422fb165">this commit</a>
      </p>
      <p>
      This is significant in that the author has in past solo endeavours opted to work in long sprints of activity between documentation. What documentation does emerge from these processes is at most frequent made in haste following the end of a session. This coarse degree of resolution hinders future effort to speculate on decisions made and to imagine recourse for ongoing work. Further, it has been the experience of this author that such an opaque visibility of the decision-making in a creative work impedes its opening up to future collaboration. [cite the following:] that increased frequency of work contribution segmentations coincide with greater reflexivity in process, and aid in cognitive load. [[Matthew Gaudet said that my “conversational commits … feel similar .. [to] ‘rubber duck’ debugging; the idea being you explain the problem to a rubber duck in your office and it helps you identify gaps in your thinking and solve the problem.” (private correspondence 2017-04-30)

        <span class="cmd">git checkout</span> has many uses,

        For example, to switch from master branch to dev branch,

        into a single command by typing <span class="cmd">git checkout -b branchname</span>.

        <span class="cmd">git reset</span> will move HEAD and the current branch back to wherever
        you specify, abandoning any commits that may be left behind. This is useful to undo a commit
        that you no longer need.
      </p>
      <p>
        This command is normally used with one of three flags: "--soft", "--mixed", and "--hard".
        The soft and mixed flags deal with what to do with the work that was inside the commit after
        you reset, and you can read about it <a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html">here</a>.
        Since this visualization cannot graphically display that work, only the "--hard" flag will work
        on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ref "HEAD^" is usually used together with this command. "HEAD^" means "the commit right
        before HEAD. "HEAD^^" means "two commits before HEAD", and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you must <b>never</b> use <span class="cmd">git reset</span> to abandon commits
        that have already been pushed and merged into the origin. This can cause your local repository
        to become out of sync with the origin. Don't do it unless you really know what you're doing.

    <div id="ExplainGitRevert-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        To undo commits that have already been pushed and shared with the team, we cannot use the
        <span class="cmd">git reset</span> command. Instead, we have to use <span class="cmd">git revert</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="cmd">git revert</span> will create a new commit that will undo all of the work that
        was done in the commit you want to revert.

        <span class="cmd">git merge</span> will create a new commit with two parents. The resulting
        commit snapshot will have the all of the work that has been done in both branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was no divergence between the two commits, git will do a "fast-forward" method merge.</br>
        To see this happen, checkout the 'ff' branch and then type <span class="cmd">git merge dev</span>.

        new "base" is at the point you specify.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should pay close attention to the commit IDs of the circles as they move when you do this exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I put "move" in quotations because this process actually generates brand new commits with
        completely different IDs than the old commits, and leaves the old commits where they were. For this reason,
        you never want to rebase commits that have already been shared with the team you are working with.

    <div id="ExplainGitFetch-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">

    <div id="ExplainGitPull-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        A <span class="cmd">git pull</span> is a two step process that first does a <span class="cmd">git fetch</span>,
        and then does a <span class="cmd">git merge</span> of the remote tracking branch associated with your current branch.
        If you have no current branch, the process will stop after fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the argument "--rebase" was given by typing <span class="cmd">git pull --rebase</span>, the second step of
        pull process will be a rebase instead of a merge. This can be set to the default behavior by configuration by typing:
        <span class="cmd">git config branch.BRANCHNAME.rebase true</span>.

        A <span class="cmd">git push</span> will find the commits you have on your local branch that the corresponding branch
        on the origin server does not have, and send them to the remote repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, all pushes must cause a fast-forward merge on the remote repository. If there is any divergence between
        your local branch and the remote branch, your push will be rejected. In this scenario, you need to pull first and then
        you will be able to push again.
