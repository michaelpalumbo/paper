<h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        The ability to keep track of changes made by a creator over the course of a project's timeline is beneficial to many facets of production. This includes revision, editing, moving between drafts, and collecting and implementing feedback. Collaboration between individuals, whether locally or spatio-temporally distributed, requires greater scaffolding of communication and transmission of artefacts, such as facilitating concurrent access to the developing corpus of work, effectively managing how work and knowledge about the work-in-progress are shared, and enabling efficient movement between drafts and revisions. In the field of software engineering, <i>version control systems (VCS) </i> are employed by developers to mitigate these issues by storing code in digital archives called repositories, which also contain details about the history of the project, contributions, and other useful metrics (Bird et al. 2009; Carlsson 2013). VCS are not limited to the archiving and transmission of code. In the spirit of the important contribution of Diana Taylor's advocation for a convergence of Perfomance Studies and Latin American Studies scholarship towards "...a real engagement between two fields that helps us rethink both," (Taylor XVIII) this paper examines the potential that VCS may offer to research-creation in the context of theatre and performance studies. Drawing on distributed creativity, which extends "creative processes into the world of others, of objects ... [and of environments, and observes] how they unfold in time," (Glaveanu 23) a VCS has been used to write, document and analyze this paper's own socio-technical ontogenesis, or its "...coming into being." (Boesch 182) 


        <!--This paper presents a vision towards Drawing on literature from performance studies, distributed creativity, and mining software repositories (MSR), this paper presents a vision towards use of VCS in the contexts of performance studies and distributed creativity research, and will leverage the VCS <i>git</i> as a research-creation tool in presenting a detailed account of this paper’s own ontogenesis. -->

<h4>Background</h4>
<p></p>
<p> Interest in the deployment of VCS in disparate contexts is gaining momentum. Those engaged in the field of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) has taken up interest in studying the effects of integrating VCS in the classroom. For example, Francese, Gravino, Risi, Scanniello, and Tortora (2015) present on the experiences of students using VCS in a course on developing software for mobile platforms, and assert the importance of leveraging project-based learning in the classroom. (Francese et al 1) Zagalsky, Feliciano, Storey, Zhao, and Wang (2015) focus on the educational potential of the social networking features within the cloud-based VCS <i>Github</i>, towards supporting collaborative learning and group work. (Zagalsky et al 1)
</p>

<p>Research into the implications of VCS in collaborative research and production are also on the rise, and can be found in such fields as computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW), and Human Factor in Computing Systems (CHI). Kalliamvakou, Damian, Singer, and German (2014) show how using Github in team-based software development contributes to emergent organized activity, and positively affects collaboration as defined by "...coordination, communication, awareness, task division, and conflict resolution." (Kalliamvakou et al 1) Crowston and Howison (2005) conducted a study on patterns of communication in open source software projects hosted in the online community SourceForge to demonstrate that as projects grow in size, their social networks become progressivley more decentralized, while project components fracture into increasing modularity. (Crowston and Howison 1)

</p>
<p>
Another area of research that has grown with the usage of VCS, including in such contexts as those mentioned above, is that of <i>mining software repositories (MSR)</i>. MSR is a practice used by researchers to conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses on repositories. Burlet and Hindle (2015) mined repositories belonging specifically to computer musicians who use visual programming language Max/MSP , finding that "...in comparison to the general population of software developers, computer musicians' repositories have less commits, less frequent commits, more commits on weekends, yet similar numbers of bug reports and similar numbers of contributing authors." (Burlet and Hindle 292) By focusing on the code contained within a repository, researchers can infer how ideas develop and propagate. Using an analysis method called clone detection, Burlet and Hindle (2015) found that "...the vast majority of code [within these repositories] can be reconstructed from duplicate fragments," (Burlet and Hindle 293) indicating that computer musicians as designers of their own instruments frequently replicate sections of their code. This would be consistent with the design of any instrument that contains more than one -- or variations -- of the same component, such as the strings of a guitar. 
</p>


<p>
Concerned also with the study of populations of users who participate in the use of VCS, MSR can provide researchers with insights such as: the co-evolution of a project's artefacts and its contributor base; how these systems augment collective work processes; and how workflows emerge and adapt to project goals. Vasilescu, Serebrenik, and Filkov (2015) used MSR to produce a "...large data set of social diversity attributes of programmers in GITHUB [sic] teams... [culled from] 23,493 GITHUB projects." (Vasilescu et al 1) Bird, Pattison, D'Souza, Filkov, and Devanbu (2008) analyzed archived communications within mailing lists of three open source software projects, detailing "...emergent social structure and its relationship to technical activities." (Bird et al. 2008)

<h4>Two Version Control System Topologies: Centralized and Decentralized</h4>
<p></p>

<p>
VCS are tasked with storing and transferring current and past versions of work in digital archives referred to as repositories. In contemporary VCS, repositories are hosted in the cloud. In <i>centralized version control (CVC)</i> systems, such as Subversion and Concurrent Versioning System [cite], repositories are contained within a single remote location, permitting developers temporary access to a portion of the codebase for modification. [cite] <i>Decentralized version control (DVC)</i>, by contrast, is an example of a distributed approach to VCS, and operates on a peer-to-peer model, enabling the entire repository to be stored locally on all machines affiliated with the project. (O’Sullivan 2009)  This facilitates temporally and geographically displaced contributions, offline work, and simultaneous document editing. (Kalliamvakou et al 2014)            
</p>

<p>
A popular DVC is git, which is run within a computer's command line interface, such as the terminal in Unix-based operating systems like Mac OS X and Linux. The workflow used to write this paper with git can be distilled to five terminal commands: <i>git status</i>, <i>git pull</i>, <i>git add</i>, <i>git commit</i>, and <i>git push</i>, where:

       
      <p class="indented"><i>git status</i> reports the state of the local repository in comparison to the most recent commit</p> 

      <p class="indented"><i>git add [filename]</i> tells git to track a file with the specified filename. An alternate command -- and one used quite frequently throughout the composition of this paper was <i>git add .</i>, which tells git to track all recently modified, added, or deleted files </p>

      <p class="indented"><i>git commit</i> is the logging of the modification of work from the local repository to what is referred to as the staging area. A commit also contains a description of the change and reason(s) for its occurrence, written by the author of the change. An author can -- and typically does -- make multiple commits over the course of a work session</p>

      <p class="indented"><i>git push</i> uploads the commit(s) from the local repository to the remote </p> 

      <p class="indented"> <i>git pull</i> is the retrieval of the most-recent version of the master repository from the cloud to a local repository on the author's machine </p>

       
      
      <p class="indented"><img src="DVC-model.jpg" alt="DVC-model" style="width:735px;height:233px;"></p>
      <h4 style="padding-left: 50pt">Figure 1: Decentralized Version Control with git</h4> 
      </p>
      

<p>
Built on top of git is Github.com, the most prominent service offering a DVC platform. As of late 2016, Github.com is host to over 21 million publicly available repositories in the cloud. Github was chosen as the DVC for this project because its wide adoption by other scholars, developers, and educators, indicating its potential as a social network. (Jacobson and Sandler 2008; Aragon and Williams 2011; Kalliamvakou et al. 2014; Bird et al. 2008) 
</p>

<p>
Git's archiving system is designed to perform best with text-based data, which does does not preclude its use beyond the indexing of code, making it of potential interest to those who do not posess programming skills. All forms of digital data may be archived and tracked, including those used often in writing, research, and the arts, such as .docx, .xls, .txt, .jpeg, .mp3, etc. 
</p>
       
<p>
As a social network based on collective production in an open and accessible corpus of works -- and works-in-progress -- Github facilitates unprecedented knowledge-sharing and mass collaboration, and affords researchers access to rich datasets, about which insights can be gained over the interdependence of creators and artefacts, how these entities interact over the lifecycle of a project, and the propagation of ideas. The ability to freely contribute to research, creation, and research-creation repositories and concurrently analyze their content and social structure both quantitatively -- i.e. usage metrics, pattern recognition on the contents of the docs, etc -- and qualitatively -- i.e. ethnographic study of the commit messages, grounded theory analysis of issue or bug messages, etc -- is perhaps of particular interest to performance studies. 

<p>
This is significant in that the author has in past solo endeavours opted to work in long sprints of activity between documentation. What documentation does emerge from these processes is at most frequent made in haste following the end of a session. This coarse degree of resolution has, at times, hindered future efforts to speculate on decisions made, and to imagine recourse for ongoing work. Further, it has been the experience of this author that such an opaque visibility of the decision-making in a creative work impedes its opening up to future collaboration. [cite the following:] that increased frequency of work contribution segmentations coincide with greater reflexivity in process, and aid in cognitive load.
</p>

<p>
With the use of a public repository, creators open their work to early review and evaluation by others in contexts that may differ from their own. In git, a user can copy a repository belonging to another through an action called <i>forking</i>. Forking facilitates two essential workflows in the social network of git: one can alter the copied repository and propose these modifications to the intial project owner; or they can use this copy as either the starting point -- or introducing it in tandem with -- their own project, thereby embracing a project-based learning approach. Forking a repository generates a connection between one user and another, thereby expanding or strengthening community structure. (Bird et al. 2) Following a distributed creativity view of cultural production, </p>

<p class="blockquote2"> “Creative action does not end with producing a certain outcome but requires, as an integral part, the social validation of the result, its appreciation by other people, primarily experts or gatekeepers (constituting the field) within art, science, technology, etc. (Constituting the domain). In this sense the production of what is creative is distributed both between people and across time.” (Glaveanu 25) </p>

<p> Participation in the social network of a VCS embraces communalism, (Crowston et al 7:2) and is consistent with Harvie's notion of <i>craftmanship</i>, where "...craftmanship in contemporary art and performance practices [are considered] to explore how it might help value art, labour and quality not for their financial profit, but rather for their own sakes, and, in so doing, how it might offer a model of production marked not by individual self-interest but by social interdependence and egalitarianism." (Harvie 109) 

“To create means to externalize or express, to generate an outcome that has a certain form of materiality without necessarily being an object but also a process, a performance, etc." (Glaveanu 23)

</p>

<p></p>
<h4>The Commit as a Segmentation of Continuous Work</h4>
<p></p>

<p>
Following action-oriented ontology (Leman 2008), and distributed creativity, (Glaveanu —date) the acts of committing one’s work to, and pulling select work from, a repository, may be taken as segmentations of overall continuous work into discrete representations.
</p> 

<p class="blockquote2">"It is precisely distribution in time that resolves the tension between stability and change. Only when we operate with a static, a-temporal perspective are we able to isolate single segments within the uninterrupted flow of action and development, and evaluate them as either continuous with what came before or marking a rupture or discontinuity. In reality, ruptures are continuous with the past and continuity is achieved through change and transformation. This conclusion emerges, however, only when we add time to our view of creative action and, more than this, when we are able to operate developmentally, with multiple time frames.” (Glaveanu 72) </p>

<p> can then connect the gesture of making a commit to an embodied practice (Taylor 3)

<p> following Victor Turner's definition of performance through the "French etymological root, parfournir," (Taylor 3) [then Taylor cites Turner with to 'carry out thoroughly'] The carrying out thoroughly would seem consistent with the mantra of open source software design of commit early and often, which deems peer-review of code as essential towards building and maintaining useful and functioning codebases. [need to cite this]

<p>
In addition to being paired with an author's comment about its purpose, a commit is also tagged with such metadata as time, IP address, file(s), and the differences between the versions of files when compared to the previous commit containing a given file. Considering a commit as a representation of segmented overall work may problematize the formalization of a temporal unit of work, and depend greatly on habits of the author.

<h2>Mining the Repository of This Paper</h2>
<p></p>

<p>
To illustrate this repository's ontogenesis, or how it grew over the course of its development, the visualization tool <a href="http://gource.io" target="_blank">Gource</a> (Caudwell 2009) has been implemented to provide an animation of the commit history and evolving structure of the repository over time. 

      <p class="indented"><video width="560" height="340" controls> <source src="gource.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'> <source src="gource.mp4" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora, vorbis"'> </video>
      </p>

<p>
A habit developed early on in the process of writing this paper, that saw commit messages as becoming a secondary locus for reflection about the content of the changed documents, writing in dialog with the ideas expressed in the commit, such as <a href="https://github.com/michaelpalumbo/self-referent/commit/56de6878cf14df906aeb4f40b3f6130dcf2d2d58" target="_blank">this commit</a>, which began as a note about missing some content from the course, and led to some musing on possible sources and ideas to fold into further discussion. 
      </p>

      <p>
      This development is comparable to the concept of the mental model <i>rubber duck debugging</i>, where one describes an idea to a rubber duck, or some other "... inanimate [object] ... forcing the explainer to clarify and structure the explanation" (Phillips et al 2013) as a means of thinking reflexively about an idea. [[to follow this would be the study on commit messages, which I think is about best practices -- but that the act of a commit is to make known to future readers (including oneself) one's act of making change(s) to a document.  ]]
      </p>

<h4>Co-evolution of Artist and Artefacts</h4>
<p> Harvie's notion of interdependence in craftmanship is congruent also with a distributed creativity emphasis on the "...dynamic co-evolution between person and environment," (Glaveanu 73) A symbiotic relationship between an artist and their community dispells the modernist interpretation of genius. 



Taylor also 

"a temporally distributed account of creativity focusing on the entire lifespan distributed creativity view that also points to the propensity for a co-evolution of creator(s), artifact(s), and environment(s).  "Humans do not simply adapt to systems. They [also] shape them. How do we recognize elements such as choice, timing, and self-presentation except through the ways in which individuals and groups perform them?" (Taylor 7)

<p> In comparing commits across the timeline, there appears a tendency in the early commits to perform an intelligence about the subject at hand at such an early stage in the development of the project, to suggest that "I know what I'm talking about" to potential future readers of the commit history. For example:
</p>
<p>
  commit 56de6878cf
</p>
<p>
Taylor asserts that for some "...the constructedness of performance signals its artificiality -- it is 'put on,' antithetical to the 'real' and 'true.'" (Taylor 4) In further support of this might by Lavender on how the difference between gen x and gen y is that gen y knows they're being watched, which is a product of sousveillance and social networks.  Upon reflection of some of the commit</p>

<P> Another to note is that at earlier stages the diversity of files used and number of files created was greater than in the end, when development and composition of the paper generally only existed within the index.html file and then looking at its rendering in the browser. </P>1

      <p>
      As a corollary to this assertion of using git as for archiving, revision, and analysis in research-creation practices beyond software development, the source material, drafts, and revision history of this paper as a work-in-progress is currently available in its <a href="https://github.com/michaelpalumbo/self-referent" target="_blank">public repository </a>, and is being composed along a rule that deems changes be committed frequently.

        For example, to switch from master branch to dev branch,
        I would type <span class="cmd">git checkout dev</span>.
        After that, if I do a git commit, notice where it goes. Try it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to checking out branches, you can also checkout individual commits. Try it.</br>
        Make a new commit and then type <span class="cmd">git checkout bb92e0e</span>
        and see what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span class="cmd">git commit</span>, <span class="cmd">git branch</span>,
        and <span class="cmd">git checkout</span> commands to your hearts desire
        until you understand this concept.

      <p>
        You can combine <span class="cmd">git branch</span> and <span class="cmd">git checkout</span>
        into a single command by typing <span class="cmd">git checkout -b branchname</span>.
        This will create the branch if it does not already exist and immediately check it out.

    <div id="ExplainGitReset-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        <span class="cmd">git reset</span> will move HEAD and the current branch back to wherever
        you specify, abandoning any commits that may be left behind. This is useful to undo a commit
        that you no longer need.
      </p>
      <p>
        This command is normally used with one of three flags: "--soft", "--mixed", and "--hard".
        The soft and mixed flags deal with what to do with the work that was inside the commit after
        you reset, and you can read about it <a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html">here</a>.
        Since this visualization cannot graphically display that work, only the "--hard" flag will work
        on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ref "HEAD^" is usually used together with this command. "HEAD^" means "the commit right
        before HEAD. "HEAD^^" means "two commits before HEAD", and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you must <b>never</b> use <span class="cmd">git reset</span> to abandon commits
        that have already been pushed and merged into the origin. This can cause your local repository
        to become out of sync with the origin. Don't do it unless you really know what you're doing.

    <div id="ExplainGitRevert-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        To undo commits that have already been pushed and shared with the team, we cannot use the
        <span class="cmd">git reset</span> command. Instead, we have to use <span class="cmd">git revert</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="cmd">git revert</span> will create a new commit that will undo all of the work that
        was done in the commit you want to revert.

    <div id="ExplainGitMerge-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        <span class="cmd">git merge</span> will create a new commit with two parents. The resulting
        commit snapshot will have the all of the work that has been done in both branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was no divergence between the two commits, git will do a "fast-forward" method merge.</br>
        To see this happen, checkout the 'ff' branch and then type <span class="cmd">git merge dev</span>.
      </p>
      <div class="playground-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRebase-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        <span class="cmd">git rebase</span> will take the commits on this branch and "move" them so that their
        new "base" is at the point you specify.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should pay close attention to the commit IDs of the circles as they move when you do this exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I put "move" in quotations because this process actually generates brand new commits with
        completely different IDs than the old commits, and leaves the old commits where they were. For this reason,
        you never want to rebase commits that have already been shared with the team you are working with.

    <div id="ExplainGitFetch-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        <span class="cmd">git fetch</span> will update all of the "remote tracking branches" in your local repository.
        Remote tracking branches are tagged in grey.

      <div class="playground-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPull-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        A <span class="cmd">git pull</span> is a two step process that first does a <span class="cmd">git fetch</span>,
        and then does a <span class="cmd">git merge</span> of the remote tracking branch associated with your current branch.
        If you have no current branch, the process will stop after fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the argument "--rebase" was given by typing <span class="cmd">git pull --rebase</span>, the second step of
        pull process will be a rebase instead of a merge. This can be set to the default behavior by configuration by typing:
        <span class="cmd">git config branch.BRANCHNAME.rebase true</span>.
      </p>
      <div class="playground-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPush-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        A <span class="cmd">git push</span> will find the commits you have on your local branch that the corresponding branch
        on the origin server does not have, and send them to the remote repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, all pushes must cause a fast-forward merge on the remote repository. If there is any divergence between
        your local branch and the remote branch, your push will be rejected. In this scenario, you need to pull first and then
        you will be able to push again.

        One simple example of the use of <span class="cmd">git reset</span> is to completely restore your local repository

        You can do so by typing <span class="cmd">git reset origin/master</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this won't delete untracked files, you will have to delete those separately with
        the command <span class="cmd">git clean -df</span>.

      </p>
