      DISCLAIMER: I am currently experimenting with the <a href="http://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/" target="_blank">explain-git-with-d3 library</a> by user OnlyWei to demonstrate how some of github works, within this page. Some of this page was built using a fork of this library, and not all of it has been properly cited yet!

        This paper presents a vision towards the use of version control systems and repository mining in the contexts of performance studies and creativity research, and will leverage git as a research-creation tool in presenting a detailed account of this paper’s own ontogenesis, such as: excerpts from the author’s commit comments; visualizations of the comparison of changes; and trends in the author’s process, including attentional detail and affect.

        The finished version of this papge will be the paper, including hypertext, tables, and embedded video of vizualizations.

        When working on a project, the ability to keep track of changes made by a creator over time, is essential to many facets of production, including revision, editing, moving between drafts, and collecting and implementing feedback. Collaboration demands further scaffolding of communication and distributed activity, such as facilitating concurrent access to the developing corpus of work, effectively managing how work and knowledge about the work-in-progress are shared, and enabling efficient movement between drafts and revisions. In the field of software engineering, <i>version control systems (VCS) </i> are employed by developers to mitigate these issues by storing code in digital archives — referred to as repositories — which contain details about the history of the project, contributions, and other useful metrics (Bird et al. 2009; Carlsson 2013). Drawing on literature from [[the Performance and Culture course including Lavender, Bay-Cheng, Harvie, and Taylor; distributed creativity, and mining software repositories (MSR)]] this paper presents a vision towards use of VCS in the contexts of performance studies and distributed creativity research, and will leverage the VCS <i>git</i> as a research-creation tool in presenting a detailed account of this paper’s own ontogenesis. 
      </p>

       <p>

      VCS are tasked with maintaining current and past versions of work digital archives referred to as repositories. <i>Centralized version control (CVC)</i> systems, such as Subversion and Concurrent Versioning System [cite], repositories are contained within a single remote location, permitting developers temporary access to a portion of the codebase for modification. [cite] <i>Decentralized version control (DVC)</i>, by contrast, is an example of a distributed approach to VCS, and operates on a peer-to-peer model, enabling the entire repository to be stored locally on all machines affiliated with the project, (O’Sullivan 2009) as well as in the cloud. This facilitates temporally and geographically displaced contributions, offline work, and simultaneous document editing. (Kalliamvakou et al 2014)            
      </p>

       <p>
       A popular DVC is git. The workflow used to write this paper with git can be distilled to four terminal commands: <i>git status</i>, <i>git pull</i>, <i>git add</i>, <i>git commit</i>, and <i>git push</i>, where:

       <blockquote> 
       <i>git status</i> reports the state of the local repository in comparison to the remote. 

       </blockquote>
       if git status reports any changes to local files, <i>git add [filename]</i> tells git the name of the file to send to the remote as the newest version. <i>git add .</i> is a shortcut to add all modified files. 
      
       <blockquote> 
       pull is the retrieval of the most-recent version of the master repository from the cloud to a local repository on the developer’s machine </blockquote>
       <blockquote> after an author makes a change to a file in a repository, git will report this  add occurs after an author has made some changes to a file(s) within the repository 



       , called a <i>pull request</i>; making some changes to a file or files within the repository, called a <i>modification</i>; the logging of the modification of work in the local repository, called a \emph{commit}, which contains a description of the change and reason(s) for its occurrence, written by the author of the change; and the uploading of files staged in commits, called a push. 

      <h2>DVC</h2>

      <p>
      Built on top of git is Github.com, the most prominent service offering a DVC platform. As of late 2016, Github.com is host to over 21 million publicly available repositories in the cloud. Such access to open data facilitates unprecedented knowledge sharing and mass collaboration, and affords researchers access to rich datasets, about which insights can be gained over the interdependence of creators and artefacts, how these entities interact over the lifecycle of a project, and the propagation of ideas. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Of particular interest to performance studies scholarship is the curious fact that such systems are not limited solely to the indexing of code. Rather, most file extensions may be archived and tracked, including those used often in writing and research, such as .docx, .xls, and .txt. At this outset, the author hypothesizes that the ability to freely distribute an artwork-in-process and concurrently analyze its content and social [connectivity? network?] both quantitatively -- i.e. usage metrics, pattern recognition on the contents of the docs, etc -- and qualitatively -- i.e. ethnographic study of the commit messages, grounded theory analysis of issue or bug messages, etc -- is of fascinating consequence. [[weave in arguments from bay-cheng, lavender?]]
      </p>

      <p>
      As a corollary to this assertion of using git as both an archival and revision tool in non-software development practices, this paper as a work-in-progress is currently hosted at https://michaelpalumbo.github.io/paper/ , and is being composed along a rule that deems changes be committed frequently. As an example of two commits pertaining to the development of this very sentence, see <a href="https://github.com/michaelpalumbo/self-referent/commit/ed35d4f5016282efbc67a8cd7b6d81a0048a9217" target="_blank">this commit</a>, and then compare with <a href="https://github.com/michaelpalumbo/self-referent/commit/41cdeac813edd0403299e30d0ac16207422fb165" target="_blank">this commit</a>

      </p>
      <p>
      This is significant in that the author has in past solo endeavours opted to work in long sprints of activity between documentation. What documentation does emerge from these processes is at most frequent made in haste following the end of a session. This coarse degree of resolution hinders future effort to speculate on decisions made and to imagine recourse for ongoing work. Further, it has been the experience of this author that such an opaque visibility of the decision-making in a creative work impedes its opening up to future collaboration. [cite the following:] that increased frequency of work contribution segmentations coincide with greater reflexivity in process, and aid in cognitive load. [[Matthew Gaudet said that my “conversational commits … feel similar .. [to] ‘rubber duck’ debugging; the idea being you explain the problem to a rubber duck in your office and it helps you identify gaps in your thinking and solve the problem.” (private correspondence 2017-04-30)

The following is a useful visualization for learning about the basic workflow in git.
Next to the <b>$</b> sign below, experiment with entering commands like <i>git pull</i>, <i>git commit</i>, <i>git push</i>, and <i>git commit -m "added a sentence about Derrida"</i>, and observe the results.

      <p>
        A <span class="cmd">git pull</span> is a two step process that first does a <span class="cmd">git fetch</span>,
        and then does a <span class="cmd">git merge</span> of the remote tracking branch associated with your current branch.
        If you have no current branch, the process will stop after fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the argument "--rebase" was given by typing <span class="cmd">git pull --rebase</span>, the second step of
        pull process will be a rebase instead of a merge. This can be set to the default behavior by configuration by typing:
        <span class="cmd">git config branch.BRANCHNAME.rebase true</span>.

        on the origin server does not have, and send them to the remote repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, all pushes must cause a fast-forward merge on the remote repository. If there is any divergence between
        your local branch and the remote branch, your push will be rejected. In this scenario, you need to pull first and then
        you will be able to push again.
