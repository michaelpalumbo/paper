      DISCLAIMER: I am currently experimenting with the <a href="http://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/" target="_blank">explain-git-with-d3 library</a> by user OnlyWei to demonstrate how some of github works, within this page.

        This paper presents a vision towards the use of version control systems and repository mining in the contexts of performance studies and creativity research, and will leverage git as a research-creation tool in presenting a detailed account of this paper’s own ontogenesis, such as: excerpts from the author’s commit comments; visualizations of the comparison of changes; and trends in the author’s process, including attentional detail and affect.

        The finished version of this papge will be the paper, including hypertext, tables, and embedded video of vizualizations.

      <p>
        When working on a project, the ability to keep track of changes made by a creator over time, is essential to many facets of production, including revision, editing, moving between drafts, and collecting and implementing feedback. Collaboration demands further scaffolding of communication and distributed activity, such as facilitating concurrent access to the developing corpus of work, effectively managing how work and knowledge about the work-in-progress are shared, and enabling efficient movement between drafts and revisions. In the field of software engineering, <i>version control systems (VCS) </i> are employed by developers to mitigate these issues by storing code in digital archives — referred to as repositories — which contain details about the history of the project, contributions, and other useful metrics (Bird et al. 2009; Carlsson 2013). Drawing on literature from [[the Performance and Culture course including Lavender, Bay-Cheng, Harvie, and Taylor; distributed creativity, and mining software repositories (MSR)]] this paper presents a vision towards use of VCS in the contexts of performance studies and distributed creativity research, and will leverage the VCS <i>git</i> as a research-creation tool in presenting a detailed account of this paper’s own ontogenesis. 
      </p>

       <p>

      VCS are tasked with maintaining current and past versions of work digital archives referred to as repositories. <i>Centralized version control (CVC)</i> systems, such as Subversion and Concurrent Versioning System [cite], repositories are contained within a single remote location, permitting developers temporary access to a portion of the codebase for modification. [cite] <i>Decentralized version control (DVC)</i>, by contrast, is an example of a distributed approach to VCS, and operates on a peer-to-peer model, enabling the entire repository to be stored locally on all machines affiliated with the project, (O’Sullivan 2009) as well as in the cloud. This facilitates temporally and geographically displaced contributions, offline work, and simultaneous document editing. (Kalliamvakou et al 2014)            
      </p>

       <p>
       A popular DVC is git. The workflow used to write this paper with git can be distilled to four terminal commands: <i>git status</i>, <i>git pull</i>, <i>git add</i>, <i>git commit</i>, and <i>git push</i>, where:

      <p class="indented"><i>git status</i> reports the state of the local repository in comparison to the remote </p> 
      
      <p class="indented"><i>git add [filename]</i> tells git the name of a modified file to send to the remote as the newest version </p>

       

       <p class="indented"><i>git commit</i> is the logging of the modification of work from the local repository to what is referred to as the staging area. A commit also contains a description of the change and reason(s) for its occurrence, written by the author of the change. An author can -- and typically does -- make multiple commits over the course of a work session</p>

       <p class="indented"><i>git push</i> uploads the commit(s) from the local repository to the remote </p> 

       <p class="indented"> <i>git pull</i> is the retrieval of the most-recent version of the master repository from the cloud to a local repository on the author's machine </p>

      <p>
      Built on top of git is Github.com, the most prominent service offering a DVC platform. As of late 2016, Github.com is host to over 21 million publicly available repositories in the cloud. Github was chosen as the DVC for this project because its wide adoption by other scholars, developers, and educators, indicating its potential as a social network. (Jacobson and Sandler 2008; Aragon and Williams 2011; Kalliamvakou et al. 2014; Bird et al. 2008) 
      </p>

      <p>
       Of interest to those who are unfamiliar with working with code is the curious fact that git's archiving system is not limited solely to the indexing of code. Rather, most file extensions may be archived and tracked, including those used often in writing and research, such as .docx, .xls, and .txt. 

       As a social network based on collective production in an open and accessible corpus of works -- and works-in-progress -- Github facilitates unprecedented knowledge sharing and mass collaboration, and affords researchers access to rich datasets, about which insights can be gained over the interdependence of creators and artefacts, how these entities interact over the lifecycle of a project, and the propagation of ideas. The ability to freely contribute to research, creation, and research-creation repositories and concurrently analyze their content and social structure both quantitatively -- i.e. usage metrics, pattern recognition on the contents of the docs, etc -- and qualitatively -- i.e. ethnographic study of the commit messages, grounded theory analysis of issue or bug messages, etc -- is perhaps of particular interest to performance studies. 

      A study on "...emergent social structure and its relationship to technical activities [in open source software projects]" (Bird et al. 2008) analyzed archived communications within mailing lists and the content of the respective repositories.   [[weave in arguments from bay-cheng, lavender?]]


      </p>

      

      <p>
      As a corollary to this assertion of using git as both an archival and revision tool in research-creation practices that either do not engage in software development, or are hybrid, this paper as a work-in-progress is currently hosted at https://michaelpalumbo.github.io/paper/ , and is being composed along a rule that deems changes be committed frequently. As an example of two commits pertaining to the development of this very sentence, see <a href="https://github.com/michaelpalumbo/self-referent/commit/ed35d4f5016282efbc67a8cd7b6d81a0048a9217" target="_blank">this commit</a>, and then compare with <a href="https://github.com/michaelpalumbo/self-referent/commit/41cdeac813edd0403299e30d0ac16207422fb165" target="_blank">this commit</a>

      </p>
      <p>
      This is significant in that the author has in past solo endeavours opted to work in long sprints of activity between documentation. What documentation does emerge from these processes is at most frequent made in haste following the end of a session. This coarse degree of resolution may hinder future effort to speculate on decisions made, and to imagine recourse for ongoing work. Further, it has been the experience of this author that such an opaque visibility of the decision-making in a creative work impedes its opening up to future collaboration. [cite the following:] that increased frequency of work contribution segmentations coincide with greater reflexivity in process, and aid in cognitive load. A habit developed early on in the process of writing this paper that saw commit messages as becoming a secondary locus for reflection about the content of the changed documents, writing in dialog with the ideas expressed in the commit, such as <a href="https://github.com/michaelpalumbo/self-referent/commit/56de6878cf14df906aeb4f40b3f6130dcf2d2d58" target="_blank">this commit</a>, which began as a note about missing some content from the course, and led to some musing on possible sources and ideas to fold into further discussion. 
      </p>


      <p>
      In mental modelling, this is comparable to the concept of <i>rubber duck debugging</i>, where one describes an idea to a rubber duck, or some other "... inanimate [object] ... forcing the explainer to clarify and structure the explanation" (Phillips et al 2013) to themselves as a means of thinking reflexively about the idea. [[to follow this would be the study on commit messages, which I think is about best practices -- but that the act of a commit is to make known to future readers (including oneself) one's act of making change(s) to a document.  ]]

      Analysis of github repository(s) (studying groups of use/or their work): Repository mining is a practice used by software researchers to conduct both qualitative and quantitative analyses on repositories as well as on the people who commit work on the repositories. study populations within the github network, and determine attributes such as community structure (Bird et al. 2008). Analysis of a repository is useful because it affords researchers a view on the co-evolution of a project and its contributors, how workflows emerge and adapt to project goals, environmental conditions, and changes in personnel. See also this[ the empirical study on commits from computer music community may be interesting in this section!
     
      On Vizualisation: 

      To illustrate how a repository grows over time, an author could make use of repository vizualisation tools. One such tool is Gource [cite]. As can be seen below, the commit history and the evolving structure of the repository are represented in an animation. 

 <video width="560" height="340" controls> <source src="gource.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'> <source src="gource.mp4" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora, vorbis"'> </video>

detection of clones in a software system can promote code reuse, refer novice programmers to existing related code, as well as locate software entities that may benefit from refactoring.

Burlet and Hindle conducted a study on the use of [reword: software development practices of computer musicians when programming in] programming languages such as Max/MSP and Puredata. They highlight a need for further research into “how computer musicians program, share, and collaborate on patches developed in … languages [like] … Max/MSP. … [And] if computer musicians use software engineering tools such as source control repositories or bug trackers and where they seek help with programming syntax and semantics.” (1)

      </p>
      <p>
        This command is normally used with one of three flags: "--soft", "--mixed", and "--hard".
        The soft and mixed flags deal with what to do with the work that was inside the commit after
        you reset, and you can read about it <a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html">here</a>.
        Since this visualization cannot graphically display that work, only the "--hard" flag will work

      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I put "move" in quotations because this process actually generates brand new commits with
        completely different IDs than the old commits, and leaves the old commits where they were. For this reason,
        you never want to rebase commits that have already been shared with the team you are working with.
