A research paper on using a distributed version control system to write a paper. As an archive, it presents interesting use 

I will use a number of statistics gathering tools to track details about my activity when writing this paper. For instance, I will get a record of time spent using each app on my machine during paper-writing sessions. 

Paper’s focus on the potential usefulness of repositories as archives and towards scaffolding of collaborations. 

so the background of this paper, will be to introduce repositories. 


The archival of software source code and project collaborator contributions is made possible by a system known as version control, with the most popular public service in use being Github.com, which as of late 2016 had over 21 million publicly hosted projects. 
after detailing some of git’s features, then:

Applying as a research-creation tool, this paper will present a detailed account of the ontogenesis of the project, which may include: excerpts from the author’s comments about a change to a draft; visualizations comparing changes to the work; trends in the author’s process, including attentional detail and affect; 

This paper will be written using the following workflow: each time a change is made to any part of the working directory — for example, this sentence — the change will be logged using a ‘git commit’, and paired with a comment describing the change and reason.

usage of git as a writing tool

 citing of publicly available software source code as a supplement to a published work is becoming a common practice in computer music research, and the broader fields of digital media and the sciences, the impacts of implementing a version control system and social network — like that of GitHub.com — on the performance laboratory context have not been explicitly studied or discussed. In view of this, this paper will be an exploration of the use of a decentralized version control system for use as an archival performance. 



In October 2016, the Distributed Performance and Sensorial Immersion Lab set up a git private repository to…
