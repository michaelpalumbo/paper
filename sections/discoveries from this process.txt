I started writing a comment about how the proposal is lacking in theory from the class. then i started folding in theory from the class into the commit message, initially as an example, which then turned into writing a note to myself, and then I gained steam and now have a decent sense of direction for the P&C research. so the commit message can be a useful tool unto itself for research. Maybe you can cite Matthew Gaudet’s mention of interest in the commit history and narrative…
