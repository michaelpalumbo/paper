# Background

This paper presents a vision towards the use of version control systems and repository mining in the contexts of performance studies and creativity research, and will leverage git as a research-creation tool in presenting a detailed account of this paper’s own ontogenesis, such as: excerpts from the author’s commit comments; visualizations of the comparison of changes; and trends in the author’s process, including attentional detail and affect. 

The finished version of this papge will be the paper, including hypertext, tables, and embedded video of vizualizations. 

Below is the template provided by github to help me build this paper using markdown!
